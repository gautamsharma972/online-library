# Online Library - With PHP

In this repo I've tried to make an online library system using php, html, css and js. In this project the user can create and log into their account - and search, filter, and add book to their personal bookshelf. 


## How to run this project?

So, to run this project, you'll need to have the basic required softwares like `xampp` or `wampp` server, `mysql` database. 

Clone or download the repository to your local computer:

```
>> git clone https://github.com/sachinshrmaa/online-library.git 

```

Add the repo to your htdocs folder inside the xampp main folder.

Hope you got some idea about hown to ru this project. And If not feel free to tweet me on twitter @sachinshrmaa or mail me at : contact@sachinshrmaa.com
