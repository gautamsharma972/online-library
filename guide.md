So at very first I created a database on my Phpmyadmin and then created a table for user registration and signup.

First create the database in PHPMyAdmin, named - MyLib using the following command - 
<code>
create database mylib
</code>

Next create table user having the following attributes - 
<code>
create table users (
    
)
</code>
